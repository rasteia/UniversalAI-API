Here's an example of a code style guide for writing multiple chunks of code by different AI agents:

Naming conventions:
Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.
Use CamelCase for class names and PascalCase for function and variable names.
Use snake_case for file names.
Avoid using abbreviations or acronyms unless they are widely understood and unambiguous.
Indentation:
Use 4 spaces for indentation.
Do not use tabs.
Use consistent indentation throughout the codebase.
Formatting:
Use consistent formatting throughout the codebase.
Place opening curly braces on the same line as the function or class declaration.
Use one space between operators and operands.
Use line breaks to separate logical sections of code.
Commenting:
Use comments to explain complex or non-obvious parts of the code.
Use inline comments sparingly, and only when necessary.
Use descriptive function and method signatures, and document their purpose and parameters.
Testing:
Write tests for all non-trivial code.
Use consistent test naming conventions.
Use descriptive test case names.
Use meaningful and descriptive test assertions.
Version Control:
Use Git for version control.
Use feature branching and pull requests to manage code changes.
Write meaningful and descriptive commit messages.
Keep the codebase clean by removing unused code and files.
By following these guidelines, AI agents can more easily collaborate on a codebase without introducing inconsistencies or errors. Additionally, these guidelines can help make the codebase more maintainable and understandable for human developers who may need to work on it in the future.
